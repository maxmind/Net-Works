- The Net::Works::Network->range_as_subnets() method now takes a version
  parameter so you can explicitly ask for IPv4 or IPv6.


0.09     2013-02-06

- Documentation fixes


0.08     2013-02-04

- Fixed type constraints so they inline.


0.07     2012-12-11

- Removed all use of Data::Validate::IP and NetAddr::IP::Util.

- Validate all data passed to the constructor.


0.06     2012-12-07

- Require Socket 1.99+. This fixes test failures with old version of Socket
  that don't provide inet_ntop or inet_pton.


0.05     2012-12-07

- More internals rewrites for the sake of speed. We now use Math::Int128
  instead of Math::BigInt. The former is way faster.

- Net::Works::Network now has two constructors, new_from_string() and
  new_from_integer(), just like Net::Works::Address. The new() method should
  no longer be used.


0.04     2012-12-04

- Speed improvements for Net::Works::Network->range_as_subnets(). For most use
  cases this won't matter but for our use at MaxMind we end up calling this a
  lot so making it faster is a big win.


0.03     2012-12-04

- Work around a bug in Data::Validate::IP's is_ipv6 sub. It doesn't think '::'
  is a valid IPv6 address. If you created a Net::Works::Network object with
  this address it would treat it as an IPv4 address unless you explicitly
  specified the version.


0.02     2012-12-03

- All changes in this release come from Greg Oschwald.

- Major internals rewrite to speed things up. We no longer wrap NetAddr::IP
  objects (but we do use NetAddr::IP::Util).

- Net::Works::Network->mask_length() now returns the mask as passed to the
  constructor, not the number of bits in the mask. The ->bits method returns
  the number of bits in the mask (32 or 128).

- The Network->netmask_as_integer() method no longer exists (use mask_length()
  instead). The ->max_netmask_as_integer() method has been renamed to
  ->max_mask_length().

- Added Net::Works::Address->mask_length() and ->bits() (which always return
  the same thing).

- We use Socket::inet_ntop to stringify addresses.


0.01     2012-11-28

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
